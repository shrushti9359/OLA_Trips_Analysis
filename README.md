# OLA_Trips_Analysis
Hi, 🙋‍♀️
I'm excited to share insights from our analysis of OLA trips! Leveraging SQL queries, I've delved into key metrics like cancellation rates, booking rates, and hotspot locations for customer engagement. By examining the data, I've pinpointed areas where cancellations are prevalent, identified high-demand regions, and gauged driver earnings. Our analysis isn't just about numbers; it's about understanding trends to enhance OLA's service quality and optimize driver experiences. Through SQL-driven exploration, we're unveiling actionable insights to shape OLA's journey towards greater efficiency and customer satisfaction.
